                The ipn.arpa Zone and IPN DNS Operations
                      draft-ek-dtn-ipn-arpa-latest

Abstract

   This document requests a DNS parent for IPN addresses, discusses the
   registration procedures and management of the DNS zone, as well as
   some operational recommendations.  This document specifies that IPN
   addresses may have a DNS representation of the form
   1.978879.ipn.arpa, for IPN node 1 under IPN Allocator 978879.

   This document also describes how this DNS structure can be useful in
   locating the Bundle Protocol (BP) Convergence Layer (CL) endpoint(s)
   of the BP Agent responsible for a given IPN address.

3.  Concept of Operations

   The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) of a BP Agent may be populated
   from a variety of sources.  Typically, explicit (manual)
   configuration is given to associate BP destination endpoints with the
   Convergence Layer parameters required to establish communication with
   a responsible receiving BP Agent.

   A BP Agent may also dynamically create a FIB entry by querying for
   DNS Resource Records as follows.

   Consider a space agency with a registered IPN Allocator ID of 978879
   that published the following two DNS zones:

   ; zone 978879.ipn.arpa.
   @   IN SOA ns1.space-agency.example ...
   1   IN PTR lunar-orbiter1.space-agency.example.
   2   IN PTR mars-orbiter2.space-agency.example.
   500 IN PTR research-department.space-agency.example.


   ; zone space-agency.example.
   @ IN SOA ns1.space-agency.example ...

   antenna-relay IN A 192.0.2.1
   antenna-relay IN AAAA 2001:db8::1

   lunar-orbiter1 IN TXT "{'norad-id': '81111'}}"
   _dtn-bundle._tcp.2 IN SRV 1 1 4556 antenna-relay.space-agency.example.

   mars-orbiter2 IN TXT "{'norad-id': '82222'}}"
   _dtn-bundle._udp.2 IN SRV 1 1 4556 antenna-relay.space-agency.example.

   cloud-service IN A 192.0.2.5
   cloud-service IN AAAA 2001:db8::5

   _dtn-bundle._tcp.research-department IN SRV 1 1 4556 cloud-service.space-agency.example.
   _dtn-bundle._udp.research-department IN SRV 1 1 4556 cloud-service.space-agency.example.

   A BP Agent, perhaps collocated at a landing station, which had
   received a Bundle destined for ipn:978879.500.345 could determine the
   proper TCP and UDP CL IP addresses and ports by:

   *  querying for a PTR record associated with 500.978879.ipn.arpa

   *  (receiving research-department.space-agency.example)

   *  querying for an SRV record associated with _dtn-
      bundle._tcp.research-department.space-agency.example (ditto for
      ._udp)

   *  (receiving port 4556 and hostname cloud-service.space-
      agency.example.)

   *  querying for A and AAAA records for cloud-service.space-
      agency.example.

   *  (receiving 192.0.2.5 and 2001:db8::5)

   The BP Agent at the landing station could then attempt to initiated a
   [TCPCL] or [UDPCL] connection to [2001:db8::5]:4556, for example, and
   attempt to deliver the given Bundle.

   Similarly, a researcher attempting to send a Bundle payload to mars-
   orbiter2.space-agency.example could use a BP Agent capable of
   querying DNS and learning about the [UDPCL] endpoint at
   192.0.2.1:4556.  Once the Bundle had been forwarded to antenna-
   relay.space-agency.example, it would be the antenna-relay's
   responsibility to forward it to the spacecraft.

   Any future CLs that define DNS records (e.g. SVCB records, etc) may
   be added to the space-agency.example zone and, though the use of PTR
   records in the 978879.ipn.arpa zone, be discovered by appropriately
   capable BP agents.

4.  Operational Considerations

   TODO Operational

   Note that use of DNS may not be appropriate for all network
   environments.  Any deployments where querying DNS might not align
   with reliability or performance requirements are recommended to
   obtain BP FIB information by other mechanisms (out of scope of this
   document).

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IAB Considerations

   The IAB is requested to approve the zone "ipn.arpa" as parent for IPN
   addresses, similar to in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa "reverse DNS" for
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (respectively).

   Per [RFC9758], IPN addresses have an Allocator identifier and an
   allocator-specific identifier (both 32-bit unsigned integers).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  'ipn' Allocator Registry List of Nameservers

   IANA is requested to augment its registration procedures for entries
   in the 'ipn' Scheme URI Allocator Identifiers Registry with a column
   for "Authoritative Nameservers".  Requesters of an Allocator or
   Allocator range MAY provide the IP addresses of DNS nameservers that
   will be considered authoritative for the .ipn.arpa zone for each
   requested Allocator.

7.2.  Guidance to Designate Experts

   TBD: things like make sure there are at least two nameserver IP
   addresses and both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are given, etc.
